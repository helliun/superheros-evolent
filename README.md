# NLP Superheros Take-home Task

## Overview

This project involved analyzing a dataset of over 1400 superheroes to gain interesting insights. Both natural language processing and data analysis techniques were used.

## Instructions for Running Code

1. Clone and cd into this repo

2. Run `!pip install -r requirements.txt -q`

3. Run all cells in the Jupyter notebook `superhero_dataset.ipynb`. I used markdown to separate
the different questions and sections

## Methodology

Both data analysis and natural language processing techniques were used, leveraging pandas, NumPy, regex, sentiment analysis, and graph algorithms.
